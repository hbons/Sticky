Sticky README

INSTALLING:
It will come, later. For now, see RUNNING.

RUNNING:
To run Sticky, run the file "run.sh".

FONT:
Make sure you have the Rufscript font for prettier notes (Sticky will default to the Sans font otherwise).
Avalible from the Ubuntu repos or download from:
http://hiran.in/content/fonts/rufscript/Rufscript010.ttf

Put it in /usr/share/fonts/ to make all users be able to use it
or ~/.fonts/ if you want it installed just for your user.
